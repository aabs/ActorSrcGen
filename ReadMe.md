# Welcome to DataflowSrcGen 
 
DataflowSrcGen is a C# Source Generator allowing the conversion of simple Actor based C# POCOs into Dataflow compatible classes supporting the actor model.

The aim of the source generator is to generate the boilerplate code needed to use TPL Dataflow with a regular class. So you can take from something like this:

And add something like this to it at compile time:
